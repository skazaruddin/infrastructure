# Scorpion Terraform AWS Configuration

Welcome to the "Scorpion" Terraform configuration. This project aims to streamline the provisioning of a foundational AWS infrastructure that deploys a web-accessible EC2 instance within a custom VPC.
This is very basic configuration, like a hello world for terraform.

## Overview

The primary purpose of this Terraform setup is to provide an EC2 instance that hosts a basic web server. The instance is encapsulated within a custom VPC for enhanced security and networking capabilities. It's designed to be accessible over the internet, making it suitable for demo purposes or foundational web projects.

## Components

Here's a breakdown of what this Terraform configuration establishes:

1. **AWS Region**:
    - Targeted AWS region as defined in `var.aws_region`.

2. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - Scorpion-VPC**:
    - A custom VPC defined by CIDR block `var.vpc_cidr`.
    - Provides an isolated network environment for AWS resources.

3. **Internet Gateway - Scorpion-IGW**:
    - Enables communication between the VPC and the internet.

4. **Public Subnet - Scorpion-Public-Subnet**:
    - A subnet with direct internet access, where resources can get a public IP address.

5. **Route Table and Association**:
    - Directs all outbound traffic from the public subnet to the internet.

6. **Security Group - Scorpion-EC2SecurityGroup**:
    - A virtual firewall that permits all inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring the EC2 instance's accessibility and communication.

7. **EC2 Instance - Scorpion-EC2**:
    - Uses Amazon Linux AMI (`var.ec2_ami`).
    - Upon launch, a user data script (`var.ec2_userdata`) sets up an HTTPD web server.
    - Displays the EC2 instance hostname on accessing the server's homepage.

## Accessibility

The EC2 instance, once provisioned, will be directly accessible over the internet due to its placement in the public subnet and the associated security group rules. You can navigate to the instance's public IP address in any web browser to view the server's greeting along with its hostname.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure you have Terraform installed.
    - Make sure AWS CLI is set up and authenticated.

2. **Initialization**:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Apply Configuration**:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

After running `terraform apply`, Terraform will provide an output indicating the public IP address of the EC2 instance. Navigate to this IP address in a browser to view the web server's content.
